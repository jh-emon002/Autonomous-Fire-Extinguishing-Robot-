# 🔥 Autonomous Fire Fighting Bot

An Arduino-ESP32 based autonomous robot that detects and extinguishes small fires. Designed for a Control Systems Lab course, the bot operates autonomously within a two-room setup using flame sensors and temperature monitoring.

## 📌 Overview

This bot is a practical demonstration of intelligent fire-fighting systems. Using flame sensors, temperature sensors, and an L298N motor driver, the robot can:

- 🔎 Detect the presence and direction of fire
- 🧭 Navigate toward the fire source
- 🧯 Extinguish fire by activating a fan/sprayer
- 🔙 Retreat if temperature exceeds 140°C for safety
- 📡 Communicate data via ESP-NOW (ESP32 to ESP8266)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Connect sensors to the Arduino and ESP32 modules as per schematic
2. Upload respective codes to:
   - Arduino UNO
   - ESP32 (transmitter)
   - ESP8266 (receiver)
3. Power up the system
4. Test flame detection by placing a small flame (lighter/candle) in front of sensors
5. Observe bot movement and response
